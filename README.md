# Police_Report_MySQL

This is my first SQL project. It's a police report on the time and year of police stops in the United States. This looked into the data given and go through exploratory data analysis.
## Lessons Learned
- Learning how to properly handle a file using MySQL
- Learning how to do a basic EDA in Pandas
- Visualizing data and answering the questions that arise from said data.
